# This file is provided to you as a starting point for the "admin.py" program of the Project
# of Programming Principles in Semester 2, 2025.  It aims to give you just enough code to help ensure
# that your program is well structured.  Please use this file as the basis of your work.
# You are not required to reference it.

# The "pass" command tells Python to do nothing.  It is simply a placeholder to ensure that the starter file runs smoothly.
# They are not needed in your completed program.  Replace them with your own code as you complete the assignment.
